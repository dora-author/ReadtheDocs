6.3 Service Instance Mapping
============================

| On the Adaptive Platform, there are two alternative ways to relate a Service Instance with a Machine Design.
| One thing is a Service Instance to Machine Mapping which is used to assign one or several Service Instances to (via a Communication Connector) a Machine Design.
| The other thing is a Service Instance to PortPrototype Mapping which is used to assign a Service Instance to a PortPrototype of SwComponentType.

| The following example shows both approaches.

6.3.1 Service Instance To Machine Mapping
-------------------------------------------

| SOME/IP Service Instance to Machine Mapping allows to define a "black box" system view that contains all necessary information 
| to configure communication without any assumptions about application software.

| The Ethernet Communication Connector is referenced by the SOME/IP Service Instance to Machine Mapping in the role Communication Connector.


<Configuration Information>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. image:: ../_static/tool/images/6.5.1_1.png

| 1) Create "radar_ProvidedServiceInstance_toMachine" Instance-Machine Mapping in Service Editor.
.. image:: ../_static/tool/images/6.5.1_2.png

| 2) Create "radar_RequiredServiceInstance_toMachine" Instance-Machine Mapping.
.. image:: ../_static/tool/images/6.5.1_3.png

.. hint:: Please see the case of “radar_ProvidedServiceInstance_toMachine” in Step 1) above.

6.3.2 Service Instance To PortPrototype Mapping
-------------------------------------------------

| Service Instance to PortPrototype Mapping represents the ability to assign a transport layer dependent ServiceInstance to a PortPrototype.
| Service Instance to PortPrototype Mapping allows to define how specific PortPrototypes of a software component are represented in the middleware in terms of the service configuration.

| In Adaptive AUTOSAR, it expresses the connection between a Service Instance and a certain Port and Process.

<Configuration Information>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. image:: ../_static/tool/images/6.5.2_1.png

| 1) Create "radar_ProvidedServiceInstance_toPort" Instance-Port Mapping in Service Editor.
.. image:: ../_static/tool/images/6.5.2_2.png

.. hint:: Proceed
        :ref:`Adaptive Application Design <doc_tool_tutorial_application>` first when you do not see any Process or Port in the drop-down list.

| 2) Create "radar_RequiredServiceInstance_toPort" Instance Port Mapping.
