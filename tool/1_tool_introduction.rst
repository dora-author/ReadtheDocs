1.1 What is mobilgene A Studio™
=======================================

mobilgene A studio™ is a powerful modeling tool for Adaptive AUTOSAR system and software.

| mobilgene A studio supports comprehensive Adapitve modeling workflow based on the AUTOSAR Methodology
| and provides convenient User Interface(UI) and Editors for each modeling type.

| Therefore, users can design and configure AUTOSAR elements efficiently and quickly with easy-to-use functions and wizards, and Editors.
