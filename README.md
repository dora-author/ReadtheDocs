Hello, this is my first ReadtheDocs project.
# See the following steps to start writing your documents with 'ReadtheDocs'.

1. Install Python higher than 3 and sphinx

: If you are using Windows, 
please go to https://www.python.org, install the latest version, and setup Environmental Variables.
And install Sphinx on your command prompt window, ~\user> pip install sphnix.
Also, if you are using pip version 20.2.2, you should upgrade to version 20.2.3, 
~Python38> python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.


See https://www.ingeniumweb.com/blog/post/how-to-install-read-the-docs-in-windows-environment/2441/ for above.
 
: If you are using Linux, 
$ apt-get install python3-sphinx
